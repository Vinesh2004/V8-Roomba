# V8-Roomba
Constructed an autonomous cleaning robot with 4-wheel drive that recieves commands through a radio reciever at the docking station. Designed and built a vaccum system to trap dirt.

Worked in a team of 6 to develop an autonomous cleaning robot using 3 Arduinos and common electronic components

Constructed a 4-wheel drive prototype that receives commands through a 2.4 gigahertz radio transceiver in the docking
station and sends commands via I2C to control the drive train

Applied understanding of aerodynamics to 3D model the propeller needed to create a strong vacuum and filtration
system to trap the dirt effectively.
